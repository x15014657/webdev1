					<h3>Personal Statement<h3><p class="normal">Target driven individual, eager to achieve 
					career goals within the I.T. sector.
					Significant customer service experience in the hospitality, hairdressing and retail industry. 
					I am highly adaptable and perform to the highest professional standards in fast paced, high pressured 
					environments. In my experience of running a retail department, where communication, delegation and listening were key
					skills essential for the smooth running of operations,
					I excelled in my supervisory and team management skills. Upon consideration of my future goals and my passion
					of computers I decided to pursue professional training
					in Computer Networking and PC Maintenance. I am now currently seeking opportunities within a company where 
					I can prove my capabilities and grow within the organisation.</p><br>
